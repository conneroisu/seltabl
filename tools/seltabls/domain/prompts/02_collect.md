{{.Information}}

Your task is to remove duplicate information from the collection of information.

You should respond with a list of the information that can be extracted from the two urls.

The format of your response should be a list of strings.
Each string should be a single piece of information that can be extracted from the two urls.

For example, if the information is:

```response
player individual scores (.individual-scores)
individual scores for players (.individual-scores)
team indiviual leaders (#team-leaders)
team scores (#dataframe.team-scores)
```

Your response should be:

```response

team indiviual leaders (#team-leaders)
team scores (#dataframe.team-scores)
```

If there is no information that can be extracted from the two urls, respond with an empty list.
